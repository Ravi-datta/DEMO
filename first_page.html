<h1>My understanding of HTML</h1>
<p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.<br> HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.<br> The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
